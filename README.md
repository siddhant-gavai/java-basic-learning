# Java Basics: Loops

I have learned the basics of Java up to loops. Here is a summary:

## Topics Covered

- Introduction to Java
- Variables and Data Types
- Operators
- Conditional Statements (`if`, `else`, `switch`)
- Loops (`for`, `while`, `do-while`)

## Example: For Loop

```java
for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    System.out.println("Number: " + i);
}
```

## Next Steps

- Learn about arrays
- Explore functions/methods
- Understand object-oriented concepts
